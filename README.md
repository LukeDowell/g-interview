## Requirements

```
In preparations for your coding round, pls bring the below –


We're excited to get to know you and give you the space to show off your skills. We'd like you to spend some time setting up the skeleton of a simple full-stack application. This allows for you to set up your
 own environment, and we strongly encourage that youuse the tools you're most confident using.
We'd like you to build a feature that shows a list of products and also allows a user to create a new product. A product should only have a name, that’s it. This should be quite simple, and the intent is to
 set up a skeleton project to work from in the interview. We want the application have a React frontend that interacts with a Spring Boot backend that reads and writes to a Postgres database. Even though the initial version of this will be a single page, we
 recommend that you setup the tools that you are most comfortable with to help the live interview to focus on creating new features.
It would be best if you also were sure to set up your editor, command line, browser tools, and any other tooling you think is valuable. Providing a README or similar instructions for how to set up your solution
 on our machines would also be helpful. We'll be using your machine to conduct the interview.
Do...
•Use the developer toolsyou're most comfortable with
•Include a README with any instructions for setting up your application
•Return this 24/hrs prior to your session (if not sooner)
Do Not...
•Add update or delete operations
•Spend time styling things
•Spend more than about 2 hours. We're not looking for a production-ready application here, just a starting point. We'll continue on together.
